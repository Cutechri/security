**2022-06-27 7:12 PM**
- Fixed an incompatibility in reg.exe.

**2022-06-26 7:28 PM**
- Added mitigations for the Microsoft Realtime Network Inspection Service (NisSrv.exe) which can prevent applications from sniffing network information.
- Added mitigations for the Microsoft Software Protection Platform Service (SppSvc.exe), which is a service that protects official Microsoft products (such as OneDrive, Office etc.) from tampering by external programs. These mitigations can help prevent malicious software from bypassing this service.
- Improved mitigations for Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe) and Background Intelligent Transfer Host Administration Utility (bitsadmin.exe), the latter having been recently added to the default list by Microsoft.

**2022-06-24 1:31 AM**
- Addressed an issue where some svchost.exe mitigations would cause issues downloading or updating apps from the Microsoft Store.

**2022-06-22 9:23 PM**
- Added mitigations for Skype.

**2022-06-21 1:04 AM**
- Improved mitigations for lsass.exe and svchost.exe in accordance with the latest revision of my security guide.

**2022-06-20 1:48 PM**
- Added mitigations for Windows.WARP.JITService.exe.

**2022-06-20 10:31 AM**
- Added important mitigations for the games hl.exe (Half-Life) and cstrike.exe (Counter-Strike 1.6), which are vulnerable to client hijacking through remote commands and malware distribution through remote server files.
- Fixed an incompatibility regarding hl.exe and cstrike.exe. These processes do not play well with Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and thus it has been turned off for both. This is one of those rare cases where DEP may not work.

**2022-06-12 12:03 AM**
- Deliberately errored the execution of sethc.exe due to a massive exploit that could allow anybody to invoke it on the Windows logon screen and produce a Console window with Administrator privileges.

**2022-06-09 11:54 PM**
- Removed mitigations for all Steam related processes due to massive issues. It is recommended to use Default Deny protection for games that could get their update servers compromised, and to defend against potential steamwebhelper.exe exploits.
- Added important mitigations for reg.exe, which can help protect against registry based attacks attempting to bypass Defender in a recent vulnerability.

**2022-06-08 9:54 PM**
- Fixed RPG Maker games (RPG_RT.exe) being incompatible with mandatory ASLR and thus not executing.
- Added mitigations for Foxit PDF Reader to combat the Folina vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190), due to it not running documents in an AppContainer such as Acrobat Reader and thus being vulnerable.
- Fixed an incompatibility in javaw.exe preventing Minecraft from opening external programs and webpages.

**2022-05-29 7:47 AM**
- Fixed an incompatibility in MultiMC.

**2022-05-26 9:03 PM**

**2022-05-25 12:00 AM**
- Significant mitigations against RCE (Remote Code Execution) and ACE (Arbitrary Code Execution) have been applied to the following Adobe products, in accordance to latest vulnerabilities targeting most of their recent versions and earlier (see CVE-2022-24104, CVE-2022-24098, CVE-2022-23187 etc.): Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Illustrator, Media Encoder and FrameMaker.
- Numerous mitigations, primarily against ACE, have been applied to companion processes to most Adobe products, such as CCLibrary.exe, CCXProcess.exe, AdobeIPCBroker.exe and sniffer.exe.
- Important mitigations against Acrobat Reader have been applied.
- Mitigations to Mediaserver.exe, main worker process to ALLMediaServer 1.6, have been applied to combat an ACE vulnerability (CVE-2022-28381).

**2022-05-21 5:12 PM**
- Removed SimExec, CallerCheck and StackPivot mitigations from all processes that utilize ACG due to a previously incorrect configuration (the three mitigations are incompatible with ACG). These mitigations are still utillized in processes that are not compatible with ACG.
- Updated Discord Stable, Discord PTB and Discord Canary mitigations to fix an issue where "Copy Image" was not working.
